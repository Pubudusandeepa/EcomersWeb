<p>Meet the topper of our list, also known as Caucasian Ovcharka, this dog can grow very large, minimum of 50kg or 110 lb. for an adult male, life span average of 10-12 years.

				<p>This breed originated from Russia and other European countries, originally used as guard dog for protecting livestock in mountain regions, these dogs are even feared by some popular wild predators such as wolves.

				<p>Theoretically, representatives of this breed are friendly enough. However, they are very similar to their wolf ancestors, what can sometimes awake fear in people, and fear in its turn arouses the animal instinct in blood of almost any dog. 

Cynologists' Comments: The Siberian Husky is a primitive sled dog and similarly to all sled dogs, the Husky has peaceable character, otherwise it wouldn’t be able to perform their duties. However, similarly to all Eskimo dogs, Huskies are very energetic dogs and if they aren’t walked sufficiently it can make a complete mess of the dwelling.

At the moment the developed breed «Siberian Husky» is used not only as a sled dog but as a companion animal and show dog as well. In all three cases human aggression is unacceptable, so this breed can’t be rated among dangerous canine varieties, although it can be definitely attributed to the breeds which are difficult to train.

			<p>Rottweilers are considered to be one of the most dangerous breeds. Devoted and obedient to its owner, a great guardian. The only chance to survive when attacked by a Rottweiler is to be passive. 

Cynologists' Comments: Basically I’ve got no complaints to this part since this dog is really notable for very loyal nature and gentle attitude to the family children, although it can’t take a joke and doesn’t like strangers. Normally the Rottweiler won’t become dangerous for its special people but outsiders (including unfamiliar kids) are quite a different story. The truth is that oftentimes Rottweilers (especially males) don’t distinguish between jocular playful aggression and real aggressive actions so they can bite a strange grown-up or child even if he just wants to joke and play rather than to plan to cause serious harm.

Dogo Canarios were used as perfect big game hunters, in addition helping their owners to stifle cattle. They were also famous for their participation in dogfights, smothering victims with ease. This breed was kept on a chain and butchers were the only ones allowed to keep this breed. Make friends with a Dogo Canario is not easy at all – these creatures are incorruptible. 

Cynologists' Comments: The Dogo Canario is a watch and herding dog which never attacks first. These dogs are non-aggressive and come in action only if provoked by their adversaries. They are very ill-suited for the types of protective training where a dog should spring up on a man upon command even if he doesn’t take any actions – the Dogo Canario simply doesn’t «understand» why it should aggress. According to the standard, they represent steady dogs with predominantly sanguine or phlegmatic temperament which depend on human leadership and treat unfamiliar people warily but non-aggressively.

				<p>On the one hand, Dobermans are friendly. But if the master is in a trouble, even slightly coming from another person, they begin to display their natural aggression. 

Cynologists' Comments: There is still much to say about Dobermans. They are indeed fairly aggressive and can be dangerous for a man. Large and high-quality Dobermans are serious adversaries because of their agility and specific manner of the attack – they spring on the opponent, bite and then immediately jump back. It’s uncharacteristic for Dobermans to keep its preys; they never bite repeatedly and climb up the body as it does many service dogs. Normally Dobermans were used by the police force in pairs since it’s almost impossible to make a stand against two Dobermans. Currently Dobermans aren’t utilized for detention as it’s considered to be too traumatic and cruel. Indeed, Dobermans fall into the category of dogs which are capable of display of spontaneous aggression. And they just as Rottweilers understand a «play threat» neither to itself or its masters.
